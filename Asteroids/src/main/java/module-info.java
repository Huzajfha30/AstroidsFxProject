/**
 * Asteroids Module â€“ Controls the behavior and splitting of asteroids.
 *
 * This module handles asteroid creation, random movement, and splitting logic.
 * It provides both the plugin for spawning asteroids and the control system for
 * updating their movement and behavior during the game loop.
 * It also provides a splitter service used by the collision system to divide large
 * asteroids into smaller ones when hit.
